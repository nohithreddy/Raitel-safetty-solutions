Robotics plays a crucial role in modern-day communication and technology. It represents a rapidly
growing and captivating field that offers endless possibilities for technological advancement. As part of
our commitment to embracing cutting-edge technology and simplifying daily life, we have chosen to
delve into the realm of robotics. Specifically, we are focusing on the development of an obstacleavoiding robotâ€”a device capable of autonomously detecting and navigating around obstacles in its path.
Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental aspect of robotics, particularly in scenarios where the environment
is dynamic and unpredictable. Traditional methods like path planning may not suffice in such
situations, making sensor-based obstacle detection and avoidance indispensable. Our project aims to
address this challenge by equipping the robot with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and navigate
around them effectively.
